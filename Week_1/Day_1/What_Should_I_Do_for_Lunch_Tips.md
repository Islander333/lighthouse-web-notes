### Tips
Try experimenting with the comparison operators (<, >, ===, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using 'node' command in your terminal.

Work on your code iteratively- that means in small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use 'hungry' and 'availableTime' inside your function, try outputting their values to the terminal as follows.

```javascript
function WhatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);

}
```
